        <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headins define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>Making an Unordered List</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"UL" stands for Unordered List</li>
            <li>"LI" denotes a List Item</li>
            <li>Unordered List Items don't need to be in specific order</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Creating an Ordered List</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ordered Lists should be used</li>
            <li>When the list elements wouldn't make sense</li>
            <li>If they were in different positions in the list</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw particular attention to a word or phrase.</p>
        <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
        <p><em><strong>And sometimes you just need to shout!</strong></em></p>

        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
        <p>Thanks for reading! The basics are getting easier now.</p>
        <p>Regards,</p><br/>
